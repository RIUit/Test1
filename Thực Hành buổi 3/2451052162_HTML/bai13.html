            <h2>The First Bicycle</h2>
            <p>
                In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around
                the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable,
                mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing
                your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of
                gliding walk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely
                of wood. This enjoyed a short-lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for
                transportation in any other place than a well-maintained pathway such as in a park or
                garden.

            <h2>Further Innovations</h2>
            <p>
                The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were
                applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede
                (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker," since its wooden structure combined
                with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They
                also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in
                large cities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. (Prior to this, metallurgy was not advanced
                enough to provide metal which was strong enough to make small, light parts out of.) The
                pedals were attached directly to the front wheel with no freewheeling mechanism. Solid
                rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride
                than its predecessor.
