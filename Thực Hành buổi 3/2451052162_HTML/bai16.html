        <p><b>Magnolia</b> is a large genus that contains over 200 flowering plant species. It is named after French
            botanist Pierre Magnol and, having evolved before bees appeared, the flowers were developed to
            encourage pollination by beetle.
        </p>

        <p>Some magnolias, such as Magnolia stellata and Magnolia
            soulangeana, flower quite early in the spring before the leaves
            open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, such as
            Magnolia grandiflora.</p>
