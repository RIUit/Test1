        <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
        <p>A potager is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden. Often flowers (edible and
            non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden's beauty. The goal is to
            make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing</p>
        <h1>What to Plant</h1>
        <p>
            Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form. Many are trained to grow
upward. A well-designed potager can provide food, cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little
maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function of providing for a home in a wide array of forms -
from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality of a knot garden.
