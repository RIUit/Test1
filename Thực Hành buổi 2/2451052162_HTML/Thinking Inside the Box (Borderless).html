        <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
        <p>The cottage garden is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense
            plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.</p>   
        <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <a href="https://ou.edu.vn/" target="_blank" alt="Erro link">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries,
            although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a
            reaction to the more structured and rigorously maintained <a href="https://ou.edu.vn/" target="_blank" alt="Erro link">English estate gardens</a>
        </p>
        <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an
            emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
